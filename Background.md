## Backgrounder

Housing affordability has become a major policy issue in Nova Scotia, particularly in urban areas such as Halifax. Rapid population growth has increased pressure on the province’s housing system, with Halifax’s population growing by approximately 4% in 2023 and surpassing 500,000 residents in 2024. This growth has been driven largely by international immigration and young adults in migration. As demand for housing continues to rise, many households are finding it increasingly difficult to secure affordable housing, with renters facing some of the greatest challenges. These conditions have placed significant pressure on provincial decision makers to determine how best to improve housing affordability.
Recent rental market conditions highlight the severity of the challenge. Vacancy rates for purpose built rental units in Halifax reached historic lows of approximately 1.0% in 2023. Although vacancy increased to about 2.1% by late 2024, it remained below the ten year average of 2.7%. Even with this improvement, affordability pressures persisted. Lower priced rental units, particularly those renting for under $1,300 per month, continued to experience vacancy rates well below 1%, indicating that affordable rental housing remains extremely scarce. While rent growth slowed in 2024, average rents remained high following increases of roughly 60% over the past decade, limiting meaningful relief for renters.
The decision between prioritizing rental supply expansion or first time homebuyer incentives is challenging because each approach affects the housing system in different ways. Expanding rental supply can help ease pressure on vacancy rates and reduce rent increases driven by tenant turnover. However, new construction faces barriers such as high construction costs, labour shortages, and delays in project completion. Despite several years of strong rental construction nationally, Halifax has experienced uneven supply growth, and an estimated housing shortfall of approximately 20,000 units remains. In contrast, first time homebuyer incentives may help some households enter the ownership market, but they can also increase demand in an already constrained market, potentially placing upward pressure on housing prices without directly addressing rental shortages.
Affordability outcomes further complicate this tradeoff. Statistics Canada data show that renters in Nova Scotia face much higher rates of core housing need than homeowners. In 2022, approximately 21.0% of renter households in Nova Scotia were in core housing need, compared to only 4.5% of owner households. Renters in Nova Scotia were also more likely to experience housing need than renters across Canada as a whole. The situation is most severe among renters living in social and affordable housing, where 44.0% were in core housing need. This indicates that existing affordable housing supply is insufficient to meet current demand. By comparison, first time homebuyers experienced rates of housing need similar to other homeowners, suggesting that renters face the most significant affordability challenges.
Several policy measures have already been introduced to respond to these issues. In 2024, Halifax implemented zoning reforms aimed at encouraging missing middle housing. These changes allow up to four units as of right on most residential lots and up to eight units in transit accessible urban areas. Supported by the federal Housing Accelerator Fund, these reforms are intended to increase rental supply by enabling small scale development. In addition, federal and provincial governments removed the full HST on new purpose built rental construction, lowering development costs. At the same time, Nova Scotia has maintained a 5% rent increase cap for existing tenants, which is currently extended through at least 2025 to protect renters from sharp rent increases.


## Key Stakeholders

# Renters
	
	Renters are the group most affected by housing affordability challenges in Nova Scotia, as they experience the highest rates of core housing need and are most sensitive to changes in rental supply, vacancy rates, and rental prices.

# First Time Homebuyers
	
	Prospective first time homebuyers are affected by housing prices, interest rates, and government incentives that influence access to homeownership, although they face lower rates of housing need than renters.

# Housing Developers and Builders
	
	Developers play a central role in increasing housing supply and are directly influenced by zoning regulations, construction costs, tax incentives, and government policy decisions.

# Municipal Governments (EX: Halifax Regional Municipality)
	
	Municipal governments are responsible for land use planning, zoning reforms, and development approvals, which directly affect the pace and type of housing supply added to the market.

# Provincial Government and Policymakers
	
	Provincial policymakers must balance affordability, fiscal constraints, and long term housing outcomes when deciding whether to prioritize rental supply expansion or first time homebuyer incentives.
