Footnotes:
1,"Age refers to the age of a person (or subject) of interest at last birthday (or relative to a specified, well-defined reference date).   Primary household maintainer refers to the first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent or the mortgage, or the taxes, or the electricity bill, and so on, for the dwelling.  In the case of a household where two or more people are listed as household maintainers, the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer.  The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which the respondent lists the persons on the questionnaire. Generally, an adult is listed first followed, if applicable, by that person's spouse or common-law partner and by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by the person."
2,"Household type  Household type refers to the differentiation of households on the basis of whether they are census family households or non-census-family households. Census family households are those that contain at least one census family. Non-census-family households are either one person living alone or a group of two or more persons who live together but do not constitute a census family. Census family households may be differentiated based on the presence of additional persons (that is, persons not in a census family)."
3,"Period of construction  Period of construction refers to the period in time during which the building or dwelling was originally constructed.  This refers to the period in which the building was completed, not the time of any later remodeling, additions or conversions.  For properties having multiple residential structures, this refers to the period in which the most recent structure was completed."
4,"Primary household maintainer - The first person in the household identified as someone who pays the rent, or the mortgage, or the taxes, or the electricity or other services or utilities for the dwelling. When more than one member of the household contributes to the payments, the first person listed is chosen as the primary household maintainer. If no person in the household is identified as making any such payments, the first person listed is selected by default.  The order of the persons in a household is determined by the order in which they are listed on the questionnaire. Generally, an adult is listed first followed, if applicable, by their spouse or common-law partner and then by their children. The order does not necessarily correspond to the proportion of household payments made by each person."
5,"For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Household type; Census family structure."
7,"Tenure refers to whether the household owns or rents their private dwelling. The private dwelling may be situated on rented or leased land or be part of a condominium. A household is considered to own their dwelling if some member of the household owns the dwelling even if it is not fully paid for, for example if there is a mortgage or some other claim on it. A household is considered to rent their dwelling if no member of the household owns the dwelling. A household is considered to rent that dwelling even if the dwelling is provided without cash rent or at a reduced rent, or if the dwelling is part of a cooperative.  For historical and statutory reasons, shelter occupancy on Indian reserves or settlements does not lend itself to the usual classification by standard tenure categories. Therefore, a special category, 'dwelling provided by the local government, First Nation or Indian band,' has been created for census purposes.  Presence of mortgage payments refers to whether an owner household makes regular mortgage or loan payments for their dwelling.   Subsidized housing refers to whether a renter household lives in a dwelling that is subsidized. Subsidized housing includes rent geared to income, social housing, public housing, government-assisted housing, non-profit housing, rent supplements and housing allowances."
6,"Dwelling condition    'Dwelling condition' refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions.     Housing suitability  Housing suitability refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS.  'Housing suitability' assesses the required number of bedrooms for a household based on the age, sex, and relationships among household members. An alternative variable, 'persons per room,' considers all rooms in a private dwelling and the number of household members.  Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies. Shelter-cost-to-income ratio    'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs.     Core housing need  Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy, affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds).  Housing indicator thresholds are defined as follows:  Adequate housing is reported by their residents as not requiring any major repairs.  Affordable housing has shelter costs equal to less than 30% of total before-tax household income.  Suitable housing has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of resident households according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS), conceived by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation and provincial and territorial representatives.  Only private, non-farm, non-reserve and owner- or renter-households with incomes greater than zero and shelter-cost-to-income ratios less than 100% are assessed for 'core housing need.'  Non-family households with at least one maintainer aged 15 to 29 attending school are considered not to be in 'core housing need' regardless of their housing circumstances. Attending school is considered a transitional phase, and low incomes earned by student households are viewed as being a temporary condition."
8,"Adequacy, suitability, affordability and core housing need are four housing indicators. The indicator for housing adequacy is the dwelling condition. The indicator for housing suitability (a topic often referred to as crowding) is whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. The indicator of housing affordability is the proportion of household total income that is spent on shelter costs, also referred to as shelter-cost-to-income ratio. Core housing need refers to whether a private household's housing falls below at least one of the indicator thresholds for housing adequacy, affordability or suitability, and would have to spend 30% or more of its total before-tax income to pay the median rent of alternative local housing that is acceptable (attains all three housing indicator thresholds). 'Dwelling condition' refers to whether the dwelling is in need of repairs. This does not include desirable remodelling or additions. The category 'major repairs needed' includes dwellings needing major repairs such as dwellings with defective plumbing or electrical wiring and dwellings needing structural repairs to walls, floors or ceilings. 'Housing suitability' refers to whether a private household is living in suitable accommodations according to the National Occupancy Standard (NOS); that is, whether the dwelling has enough bedrooms for the size and composition of the household. A household is deemed to be living in suitable accommodations if its dwelling has enough bedrooms, as calculated using the NOS. Housing suitability and the National Occupancy Standard (NOS) on which it is based were developed by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through consultations with provincial housing agencies. The category 'not suitable' includes households where the required number of bedrooms based on the NOS exceeds the reported number of bedrooms in the dwelling. 'Shelter-cost-to-income ratio' refers to the proportion of average total income of household which is spent on shelter costs. The category '30% or more of household income is spent on shelter costs' includes households who spend 30% or more of their average monthly total income on shelter costs. For more information, refer to the Census Dictionary: Dwelling condition; Housing suitability; Shelter-cost-to-income ratio; Core housing need."
9,"This category includes households who fall below at least one of the adequacy, suitability or affordability housing indicators."
